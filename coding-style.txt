 1. Delimit multiple parameters with comma and space
    (i.e. (foo, bar) instead of (foo,bar)

 2. In terms delimit the list of parameters from the function name
    with a single space (i.e. func (foo) instead of func(foo))

 3. Don't use a space between a function name and an empty argument
    list.

 4. In expressions leave out that space

 5. In short expressions feel free to leave out the spaces

 6. In longer and more complicated expressions spaces should be used
    between operands

 7. Lines should not be longer than 79 characters
